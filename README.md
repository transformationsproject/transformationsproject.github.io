# TFP Github Site

### Overview
- Note that this is a **public** repository.
- HTML to be hosted in an iframe is kept in the "static" folder.
- Code for this is kept in the TFP-R repository (private).

### To Do:
- Automate HTML update, either through GitHub actions or something else
- Re-upload code
- Review for feedback
- Edit any needed text/etc changes
- Group dependencies
- Figure out if this is to be a public-facing site or a placeholder for hosting widgets/etc

### Done:
- Test deployment
- Uploaded initial HTML:
  - Map: [https://transformationsproject.github.io/static/widgets/map.html](https://transformationsproject.github.io/static/widgets/map.html)
  - Chart: [https://transformationsproject.github.io/static/widgets/bar_chart.html](https://transformationsproject.github.io/static/widgets/bar_chart.html)
  - Table: [https://transformationsproject.github.io/static/widgets/table.html](https://transformationsproject.github.io/static/widgets/table.html)
